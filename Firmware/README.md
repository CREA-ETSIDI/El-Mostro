## Marlin 2.0 Bugfix Branch

__Not for production use. Use with caution!__

Marlin 2.0 takes this popular RepRap firmware to the next level by adding support for much faster 32-bit and ARM-based boards while improving support for 8-bit AVR boards. Read about Marlin's decision to use a "Hardware Abstraction Layer" below.

This branch is for patches to the latest 2.0.x release version. This is NOT THE OFFICIAL REPOSITORY

Download earlier versions of Marlin on the [Releases page](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/releases).

## Building Marlin 2.0

To build Marlin 2.0 you'll need [Arduino IDE 1.8.8 or newer](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) or [PlatformIO](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide.html#platformio-ide). Detailed instructions on [Building Marlin with Arduino](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_arduino.html) and [Building Marlin with PlatformIO for ReArm](https://marlinfw.org/docs/basics/install_rearm.html) (which applies well to other 32-bit boards).

## Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)

Marlin 2.0 introduces a layer of abstraction so that all the existing high-level code can be built for 32-bit platforms while still retaining full 8-bit AVR compatibility.
